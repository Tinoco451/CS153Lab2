# Description        

Implemented lottery scheduling in the XV6 operating system as a scheduler policy to provide 
fail allocation of CPU resources among processes using tools like GDB and QEMU to test the implementation.

In order to be able to change the priority value of the current process, we created a function that 
would be able to modify the priority value. We decided to do this by creating a function called set
priority.

In order to modify the scheduler to change from round Robin to a priority scheduler.We needed
a way to find the highest priority tasks.We added a for loop and checked the state of each
process to see if it was runnable.If it is runnable, then we have another loop that checks through
to find the runnable process with the highest priority.The chosen processâ€™s state is then set to
running.

NOTE: we have stopped maintaining the x86 version of xv6, and switched
our efforts to the RISC-V version
(https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv.git)

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)

The following people have made contributions: Russ Cox (context switching,
locking), Cliff Frey (MP), Xiao Yu (MP), Nickolai Zeldovich, and Austin
Clements.

ERROR REPORTS

We don't process error reports (see note on top of this file).

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries (see https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/).
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". Now install the QEMU PC
simulator and run "make qemu".
